# Hello_World
Test_repos

This is my first Github test repo. Hope to add more and more from here.
1. Create login
2. Create repository with repos name
3. Create branches under master
4. Try to edit or write on the created master file
5. and commit the changes. This will create the branches for the newly created branch.

On Git Bash..
Create username and emailid and it should be same as Github

$ git config --global user.name "ssingh83"
$ git config --global user.email "swetasingh08@outlook.com"

Can clone/copy the repository on local 
$ ~/Desktop/       (Set the location)
$ git clone "repository path which is copied using clone button on Github"

$ cd repository name
